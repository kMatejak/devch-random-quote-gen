You can see a live demo of my app [**here**](https://devchallenges.io/). Before I started working on this project, my knowledge of Angular was close to zero. I learned things like:

- CSS! Grid and Flex,
- Components! Breaking down Angular applications into components,
- Routing! Abandoning `if`-s in favor of routing,
- Types! Mapping api data to objects and creating custom types,
- Services! I wrote my first service,
- Deploy! I published my first Angular app
