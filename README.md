You can see a live demo of my app [**here**](https://quote-genn.netlify.app/). Before I started working on this project, my knowledge of Angular was close to zero. I learned things like:  
  
- CSS! Grid and Flex,
- Components! Breaking down Angular applications into components,
- Routing! Abandoning `if`-s in favor of routing,
- Types! Mapping api data to objects and creating custom types,
- Services! I wrote my first service,
- Deploy! I published my first Angular app
  

### Built With  
  
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)

- I can see a random quote
- I generate a new random quote
- When I select quote author, I can see a list of quotes from them
- I can see quote genre under the author
